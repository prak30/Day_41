        <p>On the occasion of 21st Foundation Day of IRCTC, I extend my warm greetings and best wishes for future to all of you. 
            Having made a beginning on 27thSept 1999, with a paid up capital of Rs 20 crs, in a short span of 20-21 years, 
            the Company has grown up to a stage where its Market Capitalisation is more than Rs 20000 Crs. 
            This is a result of the persistent efforts of all the members of Team IRCTC and able leadership of our predecessors.
            IRCTC, over a period of time has risen to the challenges arising at different points of time in the form of transfer of Catering to Railways,
            withdrawal of Service charge and so on and has come out in flying colours every time.
            It is because of outstanding efforts, hard work and dedication and contribution of each member of our team.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>IRCTC has successfully completed 21 years of journey and serving to society at large and rail passengers in particular.
